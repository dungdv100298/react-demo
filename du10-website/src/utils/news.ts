While facilitating single data transfers is the main purpose of blockchain, there are other platforms on the market. It is used in supply networks, cryptocurrencies, decentralized exchanges, smart contracts, central bank money, and many other systems.</p><p><br>Thus, it applies to more than just cryptocurrencies. There are many non-crypto blockchains. There are already over 12,000 active cryptocurrencies built on blockchain technology and the number of active blockchains continues to grow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>■Public Blockchain</strong></p><p>A public blockchain is an open blockchain that is available to everyone. Anyone can join or leave Paprik at any time, and the total number of service providers cannot be tracked. Also, since the public chain network includes countless participants, it is possible to include fraudsters, so a consent algorithm is needed to ensure the safety and trustworthiness of participants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>■Private Blockchain</strong></p><p>A private blockchain is a blockchain that limits the number of participants by requiring approval from the administrator if a participant wishes to join. Private chains can operate without strict conformance algorithms because they can track the total number of participants and reduce concerns about the inclusion of bad actors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>■Consortium Blockchain</strong></p><p>A consortium chain is a type of blockchain that lies between a public chain and a private chain. In a public chain, the number of operators is unknown and completely transparent data is king-load cast. In a private chain, on the other hand, operators are identified and data is processed private. In a consortium chain, private data processing is usually performed by a number of specific operators. There is no definitive distinction between private and consortium chains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>■Hybrid Blockchain</strong></p><p>A hybrid blockchain is a type of blockchain that combines elements of both private and public blockchains. It allows an organization to have a private permission-based system configured along with a permissionless system of public chain and control who can access certain data stored in the blockchain and what data is published.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h3">2. Top blockchain network in the world in 2022</h2><p>Beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain technology can be used for a variety of new applications. The technology's ability to increase fairness and transparency while simultaneously saving companies money and time impacts many industries, from enforcing contracts to making government operations more efficient.</p><p><br>There are several blockchain use cases beyond cryptocurrency, such as blockchain gaming. Let's take a closer look at the top blockchain platforms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://vmo112.vmo.group/uploads/1660644793320Screen Shot 2022-08-16 at 19.10.57.png"><figcaption>2022 Top Blockchain network</figcaption></figure><h4 id="h4">2.1 IBM</h4><p>IBM was one of the first companies to develop effective and open business processes using blockchain. One well-known resource is the IBM Blockchain Platform. Users of this platform can combine blockchain components in any way they see fit, thanks to the managed and full-stack Blockchain as a Service solutions it offers. With this IBM blockchain platform, users can build, deploy, and use their own blockchain networks.</p><p><br>The user-friendly, fast, and adaptable design of the IBM blockchain development tool was a priority; IBM also invested in a user-friendly interface to simplify important tasks such as setup, testing, and rapid deployment of smart contracts.</p><h4 id="h5"><br>2.2 HYPERLEDGER FABRIC</h4><p>From the "Hyperledger" suite of several tools, the "Hyperledger Fabric" software is especially dedicated to business-to-business use. Hyperledger Fabric is a consortium-like blockchain platform characterized by high confidentiality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A specific use case for Hyperledger Fabric is "TradeLens," which is used in the logistics industry. Supply chain stakeholders such as freight forwarders, shipping companies, and customs can track real-time shipping information via TradeLens. In addition, IBM Digital Health Pass, an IBM blockchain, has already launched a service that allows new coronavirus vaccination passes to be added to a digital wallet.</p><h4 id="h6"><br>2.3 ETHEREUM</h4><p>Ethereum is one of the first and best-known blockchain networks . Ethereum offers a decentralized blockchain with features similar to the Bitcoin network. A decentralized platform, Ethereum is where smart contracts are executed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is widely used because it is one of the most widely used blockchain systems. It creates a gaming setup, decentralizes the market, and allows users to create new financial apps. Eliminating third-party access to collect data for additional financial instrument research is the main goal of this technology. Of all blockchain systems, Ethereum currently boasts the largest group of underlying protocol developers.</p><h4 id="h7"><br>2.4 RIPPLE</h4><p>Ripple is also a public platform. A company called Ripple Labs Inc manages the currency. Ripple offers a payment service that allows international money transfers to be completed instantly. With traditional money transfer methods, international money transfers take several days to complete because they go through a bank. Ripple connects banks directly, allowing international transfers to be completed in seconds. Ripple is already in use by domestic and international banks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With established cryptographic and blockchain know-how developed over more than a decade, Ripple's enterprise-grade solution is faster, more transparent, and more affordable than traditional financial services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 id="h8"><br>2.5 SOLANA</h4><p>Solana is the world's fastest blockchain and the fastest growing ecosystem in cryptocurrency, with thousands of projects spanning Defi, NFT, Web3, and others. Solana ensures configurability across ecosystem projects by maintaining a single global state as the network scales. Solana's scalability ensures that transactions stay under $0.01 for both developers and users. With a block time of 400 milliseconds, Solana is all about speed. And as hardware gets faster, so does the network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h9">3. How do I choose a blockchain platform?</h2><p>When choosing the ideal blockchain platform for your company, you should consider the following factors</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://vmo112.vmo.group/uploads/1660644954868Screen Shot 2022-08-16 at 19.15.32.png"><figcaption>How to choose a blockchain platform?</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before deciding which blockchain platform to adopt, you must first select the right blockchain for your application. If you want to verify users before they access your network, you need an authorized network. Therefore, you must choose whether you need an authorized or unauthorized blockchain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 id="h10">3.1 Languages supported by the platform</h4><p>If you have a favorite language of your in-house developers, choose a platform that supports it; you might look for platforms that support different coding dialects such as Python, Java, Javascript, etc. You may also look for platforms that support different coding dialects such as Python, Java, Javascript, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 id="h11">3.2 Security</h4><p>Sensitive information must be protected by many organizations, and inadequate security can be harmful. It is critical to choose a platform that maintains security to ensure that there are no security breaches. The most popular platform for managing security is Hyperledger Fabric.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 id="h12">3.3 Smart Contract Features</h4><p>Smart contracts, which help verify, perform, or initiate actions on the blockchain network, are not supported by all blockchain platforms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h13">4. Conclusion</h2><p>Revolutionary blockchain technology is not only used for virtual currency, but is also being applied in many industries around the world today. To help you get started in the blockchain space, we have provided an in-depth overview of blockchain platforms, how to choose a blockchain platform, and a list of famous blockchain platforms and top companies. We hope that this article will be of some help to those who are considering the use of blockchain technology in their business models.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:right;">VMO JAPAN&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>`,
